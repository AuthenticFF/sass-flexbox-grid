## Dependencies
The Sass Version simply requires The Sass library to be installed.

Plain CSS and minified CSS versions can be used with no other dependencies.

## Mobile First

Use Sass Flexbox Grid's mobile-first media queries and grid classes. All styles should first be declared at small (mobile) then built outward for larger screens using min-width media queries.
