#Sass Flexbox Grid
## Overview
A responsive grid system based on [Flexbox Grid](http://flexboxgrid.com/ "flexbox-grid") and the flex property, re-written in Sass, edited and expanded upon.

Enhancements include:
- Visibility classes
- Additional 'XL' breakpoint
- Sass variables and mixins
- Customizable grid

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/drewbot/sass-flexbox-grid
```

## Dependencies
The Sass Version simply requires The Sass library to be installed.

Plain CSS and minified CSS versions can be used with no other dependencies.

##Mobile First

Use Sass Flexbox Grid's mobile-first media queries and grid classes. All styles should first be declared at small (mobile) then built outward for larger screens using min-width media queries.
